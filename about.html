                <h1>AmazeRec : You'll want to buy these!</h1>
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p><ul>
                  <li> The recommendations which use metrics like rmse are based on explicit feedback which is not always reliable in
                    figuring out what the user really wants. We want to make use of implicit feedback, in particular the sentiments in the
                    reviews left by the users. The choice of words by a user is indicative of her preference/dislike towards a certain type
                    of product. By combining this insight with traditional algorithms like collaborative filtering, we create a recommender
                    system that is more personalized to the user. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Another improvement we propose is the inclusion of reviews from reputed sources rather than from other users.
                    Collaborative filtering does a good job at identifying the user interest but the actual reviews provide little
                    information about the item. Instead, reading a review by New York times will provide a lot more relevant information to
                    the user. </li>
                  </ul></p>
                <h4>Proposed solution</h4>
                <p> We have built a complete system for recommending books to users. The backend consists of a recommender which generates
                recommendations for the users based on their past ratings. This data is stored in the json format and is loaded from the
                server when the user logs in. Then, website dynamically loads the book details and also its reviews though the Google API to
                provide the user with our recommendations for her.</p>
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Providing the user with our recommendations in an effctive manner proved to be challenging. There were several issues to consider :
                <ul>
                  <li>How to get the data from the recommender system to the user's browser? <br>
                    The information is serialized in the JSON format.</li>
                  <li>How to provide useful information to the user regarding the product?<br>
                    We use the Google API to obtain reviews from reputed sources like nytimes.com, npr.org, washingtonpost.com etc.</li>
                  We would like to deploy our system and try to get feedback from actual users, we believe that this is the best way to evaluate our system.
                  Right now, our system relies on the user's caching to get the item details which is not realistic. In a practical system,
                  we would need to have a database of all the item details from which the details can be queried dynamically.
